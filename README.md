# Fixture-Allocator
This project aims to create a program that will ease the tedious and time-consuming work process of various academic based competitions.
Various societies of the college organize various inter college level as well as national 
level competitions which have a similar progression or a similar flow of the 
competitions. This program will replace the manual processes involved in each 
of the step of this progression such as the creation of fixtures , allocating rooms, 
scorekeeping and result compilation. This program is required as it will reduce 
the time consumption in the tedious tasks, the human errors and most 
importantly it will solve the issue of transparency with the rankings and the 
marks.
The program will be able to handle all the manual works involved In an 
academic competition such as creating unique fixtures , storing marks , 
selecting top teams etc.
